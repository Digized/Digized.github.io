title: Hello World!

Ahh, when begining anything new, I think it is now required to begin with the glorious two words, **Hello World**.

*What did I begin today?* I began a hopeful journey to start a github blog/ a way for myself (and others) to look in the past to see what I have worked on.

This blog is using github pages and jekyll, github pages aren't hard to get started with, it's just that I had no idea that I could essentially create md files and not worry about linking things over and over again.

## How this began
I initially saw this functionality on one of my friend's blog ([link here](https://ryanfleck.github.io)). I was unsure of how he did it so I started investigating. I learned soon that he is using jekyll. There were obviously other factors to get this up and running as well, big one being that web scraping scene in *The Social Network*. A place where I can write my thoughts out while working on something. 

So now lets see how this came to be...

## Using Jekyll with Github Pages using Jekyll-Now

So I began with downloading jekyll -- (un)fortunately I don't have a mac, so I had to go through the *Bash on Ubuntu on Windows* route([read more](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about)). Setting this up and deploying once I realized that the default theme was not supported, *Well so how do I make my own theme?*

### Jekyll Now

Lets not make our own theme but use one that will allow us to do the thing we want to do, enter [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Now the story is simple, modify the things that you need, and push. 

This is how I created this.. hopefully it will help someone out if they faced similar issues.
