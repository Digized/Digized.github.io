For most of my reading week, Feburary 19 to Feburary 23, I decided to go to Paris.

# Planning
This is the most funny heading I have ever written because there was little to no planning that went into the trip. Heres how the whole trip was decided:
1. Friend has an exchange in Paris. Offers free residence to anyone who wants to visit. 
2. I start looking for dates to go and prices for the dates. Too expensive. I still add google price tracking for my reading week.
3. Browsing through news feed in google now, Trip to Paris $366. Ok thats great. dates? Feburary 19- Feburary 26. I think I can comeback one day after my reading week ends. No problem.
4. TICKET BOOKED.
5. Winter semester starts, professor debates having an exam on Feburary 26. Email and ask her if there can be changes. 
6. Nope. Exam is on Feburary 26. No changes will happen.
7. Ok need to change dates. Pay an extra $200 to have my return date changed to Feburary 23.
8. Professor emails class saying she cannot get a room for the exam, will have it on Feburary 28.
9. I can either spend more money and go back to the way it was. Or just try to enjoy the smaller number of days.
10. I chose option number 2.

The days came closer and I got more excited about the trip. And then on the day I was leaving I receive an email saying that there was a possibility that my return flight will be cancelled because of a storm.

# THE TRIP
THIS WAS SOO MUCH FUN. My friend was studying there so I would just take walks around Champs-Élysées. (mostly because I dont know french, and this area is a tourist attraction so most speak french).
